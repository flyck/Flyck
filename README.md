# Hi there 👋

Started my journey in the Linux Server world 💾, moved as Systems Engineer into the AWS Cloud ☁️ and transitioned into mostly serverless backend programming 👨🏻‍💻 ontop of AWS.

Passionate about product engineering vs maintenance engineering. ⚡️

Special things:
- My IDE is emacs ❤️ (config [⚙️](https://github.com/flyck/.emacs.d))
- I have build my own keyboard ⌨️ (contributed the guide [📗](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/guide))
- Totally on the javascript framework hype 🚀 (trial repo [🧪](https://gitlab.com/flyck/hype-js))

I run a shared blog together with [@hendriknielaender](https://github.com/hendriknielaender) [🤜🤛](https://double-trouble.dev/), and I also have some repos over at gitlab [🦊](https://gitlab.com/flyck).

Next up:
- Party task planner app (new tech)
- AppSync with RDS backends
- AppSync as Supergraph
- Wundergraph as BFF
