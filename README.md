### Hi there 👋

You're lookng at the profile of a Cloud Engineer from Germany. Started out in the Linux Server world 💾, moved as Systems Engineer into the AWS Cloud ☁️ and these days I sit mostly in meetings but also do some programming 🤪👨🏻‍💻.

Passionate about product engineering vs maintenance engineering. ⚡️

Special things:
- My IDE is emacs ❤️ (config [⚙️](https://github.com/flyck/.emacs.d))
- I have build my own keyboard ⌨️ (contributed the guide [📗](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/guide))
- Totally on the javascript framwork hype 🚀 (trial repo [🧪](https://gitlab.com/flyck/hype-js))

You can find my codewars profile over here [🤺](https://www.codewars.com/users/flyck)  where I keep learning, and my gitlab profile over here [🦊](https://gitlab.com/flyck).
