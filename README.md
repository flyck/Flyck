# Hi there 👋

I'm a cloud-native developer based in Germany, with a focus on backend and a background in system engineering.

Passionate about product engineering vs maintenance engineering. ⚡️

Special things:
- My IDE is emacs ❤️ (config [⚙️](https://github.com/flyck/.emacs.d))
- I have build my own keyboard ⌨️ (contributed the guide [📗](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/guide))
- I run a shared blog together with [@hendriknielaender](https://github.com/hendriknielaender) [🤜🤛](https://double-trouble.dev/)

A few repos are also over at gitlab [🦊](https://gitlab.com/flyck). Things I am working on are listed here: [roadmap](https://github.com/users/flyck/projects/2).
