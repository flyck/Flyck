### Hi there 👋

Cloud Engineer from Germany here. Started out in the Linux Server world 💾, moved as Systems Engineer into the AWS Cloud ☁️ and transitioned into mostly serverless backend programming 👨🏻‍💻 ontop of AWS.

Passionate about product engineering vs maintenance engineering. ⚡️

Special things:
- My IDE is emacs ❤️ (config [⚙️](https://github.com/flyck/.emacs.d))
- I have build my own keyboard ⌨️ (contributed the guide [📗](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/guide))
- Totally on the javascript framework hype 🚀 (trial repo [🧪](https://gitlab.com/flyck/hype-js))

I also run a shared blog together with [@hendriknielaender](https://github.com/hendriknielaender) [🤜🤛](https://double-trouble.dev/), and for work I currently use gitlab [🦊](https://gitlab.com/flyck).
