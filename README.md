### Hi there 👋

I'm working as a Cloud Engineer from Germany. Started out in the Linux Server world 💾, moved as Systems Engineer into the AWS Cloud ☁️ and these days I do more and more programming 👨🏻‍💻.

Passionate about product engineering vs maintenance engineering. ⚡️

Special things:
- My IDE is emacs ❤️ ([config](https://github.com/flyck/.emacs.d))
- I have build my own keyboard ⌨️ (contributed the guide [here](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/guide))
- Totally on the javascript framwork hype 🚀
